I assume:

* Pilot area: *Trichy small pilot polygon* (I include GeoJSON you can use). Change to any polygon if you prefer.
* You are the non-coding Project Lead (narrative, slides, pitching, LLM prompts).
* You have 1 Web Developer who can run Node/React + Python/Flask + Colab.
* If anything fails (Earth Engine signup, deployments) we use *precomputed* outputs and ngrok + a recorded demo (safe fallback).

Do *not* skip steps marked *(MUST)*. Copy/paste code and prompts verbatim to save time.

---

# Quick resources you’ll use (open these now if not done)

* GitHub repo (create): github.com/<you>/urbanclimate-dt (MUST).
* Google Colab (MUST) — for Earth Engine + compute.
* NASA Earthdata (signup): [https://earthdata.nasa.gov](https://earthdata.nasa.gov) (MUST — for dataset discovery).
* Google Earth Engine signup: [https://signup.earthengine.google.com](https://signup.earthengine.google.com) (apply now; it may be instant or take a little time).
* NASA GIBS tile example (for map basemap) — tile URL included below.

If Earth Engine access is delayed, proceed with precomputed data (instructions provided).

# Pilot polygon (paste into sample_plan.geojson)

Use this tiny Trichy polygon to demo immediately:

json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {"name":"pilot-trichy-ward"},
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates":[[[80.27,13.07],[80.28,13.07],[80.28,13.08],[80.27,13.08],[80.27,13.07]]]
      }
    }
  ]
}


(MUST: developer must commit this file in /data/sample_plan.geojson.)

---

# OVERVIEW of the two-day timetable (exact windows you asked)

* *Oct 4 — 20:00 → 00:00 (midnight)* — Foundation, live map + simulate endpoint stub, Colab bootstrap, create precomputed overlays.
* *Oct 5 — 08:30 → 21:30* — Full integration, scenario generation, LLM strategic output, UX polish, slides, video, submission.

---

# OCT 4 — DETAILED PLAN (20:00 → 00:00)

(Everything below is minute/hour level; items marked *YOU* are for you to do; *DEV* are for web developer.)

### 19:55–20:00 — final prep (YOU)

* Open Zoom/WhatsApp with the dev. Paste this plan. Say: We start at 20:00. Priority: working demo + recorded 90–120s video + GitHub by Oct 5 19:30 IST.

---

### 20:00–20:20 — Kickoff & repo (YOU + DEV)

YOU:

* Create GitHub repo urbanclimate-dt. Add README.md with one line: “UrbanClimate Digital Twin — Space Apps 2025 prototype.”
  DEV:
* Clone repo, create branches:

  
  git clone https://github.com/<you>/urbanclimate-dt.git
  cd urbanclimate-dt
  git checkout -b dev
  
* Create folder structure:

  
  /frontend
  /backend
  /data
  /notebooks
  /slides
  

*MUST*: commit empty README and folder structure.

---

### 20:20–21:10 — Frontend map + sample GeoJSON (DEV)

Goal: load map basemap (NASA GIBS) + sample polygon.

*Dev steps (copy/paste):*

1. Scaffold a tiny React app (if they prefer plain HTML/Leaflet, that’s fine — React recommended):

bash
# run in /frontend
npm create vite@latest urban-dt --template react
cd urban-dt
npm install
npm i leaflet react-leaflet


2. Replace src/App.jsx with this minimal code (leaflet + GIBS tile + GeoJSON loader):

jsx
import React, {useRef} from 'react';
import { MapContainer, TileLayer, GeoJSON } from 'react-leaflet';
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
import samplePlan from '../data/sample_plan.geojson';

function App(){
  const style = { color: 'orange', weight: 2, fillOpacity: 0.3 };
  return (
    <div style={{display:'flex'}}>
      <MapContainer center={[13.075,80.275]} zoom={14} style={{height:'80vh',width:'70%'}}>
        <TileLayer
          url="https://gibs.earthdata.nasa.gov/wmts/epsg3857/best/MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor/default/2024-08-01/GoogleMapsCompatible_Level9/{z}/{y}/{x}.jpg"
          attribution="NASA GIBS"
        />
        <GeoJSON data={samplePlan} style={style}/>
      </MapContainer>
      <div style={{width:'30%',padding:10}}>
        <button id="runSim">Run Simulation</button>
        <div id="metrics"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
export default App;


3. Copy sample_plan.geojson into /frontend/src/data/sample_plan.geojson (or import from repo /data by adjust path).

4. Start dev server:

bash
npm run dev
# If using Vite, it will show local address (e.g., http://localhost:5173)


*You (20:50)*: Verify map loads on your laptop with polygon visible.

---

### 21:10–21:45 — Backend stub: /simulate (DEV)

Goal: create endpoint that returns precomputed overlay URL + metrics JSON so frontend can call it.

**Backend code (Flask) — put in /backend/app.py:**

python
# backend/app.py
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/simulate', methods=['POST'])
def simulate():
    # For hackathon quick demo, return precomputed overlay + metrics
    result = {
      "overlay": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<you>/urbanclimate-dt/main/data/overlay_baseline.geojson",
      "metrics": {
         "peak_runoff_change_pct": 45,
         "people_affected": 2100,
         "recommendations": ["Retention basin (medium cost)","Green roofs (low cost)","Permeable paving (low)"]
      }
    }
    return jsonify(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)


*Run it:*

bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask flask-cors
python app.py


*DEV*: Expose backend to your laptop via ngrok for demo (MUST if cannot deploy publicly):

bash
# install ngrok then:
ngrok http 5000
# copy the https ngrok URL


*YOU:* Confirm POST works:

bash
curl -X POST https://<ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/simulate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'


You should receive the JSON with overlay and metrics. (MUST)

---

### 21:45–22:30 — Frontend hook to backend (DEV)

*Dev*: modify front-end runSim button to call the backend and render overlay + metrics. Minimal code snippet to add to the React app (pseudocode):

js
document.getElementById('runSim').onclick = async () => {
  document.getElementById('metrics').innerText = 'Running…';
  const resp = await fetch('https://<ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/simulate', {method:'POST', headers:{'Content-Type':'application/json'}, body: JSON.stringify({plan: samplePlan})});
  const data = await resp.json();
  // load overlay geojson
  fetch(data.overlay).then(r=>r.json()).then(gj => {
    // render overlay - if using react-leaflet add state hook or directly add layer
    L.geoJSON(gj, {style:{color:'blue', fillOpacity:0.4}}).addTo(window.map);
  });
  document.getElementById('metrics').innerHTML = `
    Peak runoff change: ${data.metrics.peak_runoff_change_pct}% <br>
    People affected: ${data.metrics.people_affected} <br>
    Recommendations: ${data.metrics.recommendations.join(', ')}
  `;
};


(MUST: developer integrate properly in React lifecycle).

---

### 22:30–23:30 — Colab: quick NASA data thumbnail + metrics (YOU + DEV)

Goal: produce *one real GPM thumbnail + one metric JSON* using Google Earth Engine in Colab. This produces the precomputed overlay and numbers.

**Colab notebook steps (copy/paste into a new Colab, notebooks/simulate.ipynb)**

1. Install & authenticate:

py
!pip install earthengine-api
import ee
ee.Authenticate()
ee.Initialize()


2. Define polygon and pull GPM IMERG mean precipitation (example):

py
poly = ee.Geometry.Polygon([[[80.27,13.07],[80.28,13.07],[80.28,13.08],[80.27,13.08]]])
gpm = ee.ImageCollection('NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_V06').select('precipitationCal').filterDate('2015-01-01','2024-12-31')
mean_rain = gpm.mean().clip(poly)
thumb = mean_rain.getThumbURL({'min':0, 'max':20, 'dimensions':512})
print('thumb url:', thumb)


3. Compute a simple metric (mean rainfall mm) and a fake peak runoff change (we will compute later properly):

py
stat = mean_rain.reduceRegion(ee.Reducer.mean(), geometry=poly, scale=500).getInfo()
mean_rain_mm = stat.get('precipitationCal', 0)
metrics = {"mean_rain_mm":mean_rain_mm, "peak_runoff_change_pct":42, "people_affected":2100}
print(metrics)


4. Export or save a GeoJSON overlay: you can create a small inundation buffer based on slope/threshold — but quick fallback: export mean_rain as a PNG and create a simple polygon buffer around creek lines (MUST for Hackathon you can precompute a fake inundation polygon derived from thresholding mean_rain).

*If Earth Engine export takes time:*

* Save metrics.json locally and commit to /data/metrics.json.
* Also save overlay_baseline.geojson sample (use small manual polygon or simple buffered polygon) in /data.

*YOU:* copy thumb url to README and to slide to show NASA data provenance. (MUST)

---

### 23:30–00:00 — LLM Intervention & small polish (YOU)

Use ChatGPT to generate final *top-3 prioritized interventions* (policy stuff) using this prompt (paste it):

> *PROMPT*:
> Input metrics: { "area":"Trichy pilot ward", "peak_runoff_change_pct":45, "people_affected":2100 }
> Task: “Write 3 prioritized, actionable urban planning interventions for municipal planners. For each: (a) concise description, (b) expected % reduction in peak runoff, (c) rough cost bracket in INR (Low/Med/High with ballpark INR range), (d) implementation time (months), (e) one monitoring KPI.”

Copy response into /data/recommendations.json and ensure front-end displays it.

*End Oct 4 midnight:* you must have:

* Frontend map + polygon + Run Simulation button (wired to ngrok backend).
* Backend /simulate returning precomputed overlay + metrics.json.
* Colab notebook with at least one Earth Engine thumb & metrics.json.
* LLM-generated recommendations.json.
* README.md with data provenance notes (GPM IMERG, SRTM, WorldPop, VIIRS).
  If any of these fail, still have recorded steps for fallback and continue.

---

# OCT 5 — DETAILED PLAN (08:30 → 21:30)

This day is about turning precomputed prototype into a polished demo and submission. Exact minute/hour schedule below.

---

### 08:30–09:00 — Morning sync, check status (YOU + DEV)

* Confirm backend ngrok, frontend URL, sample overlays present, simulate.ipynb accessible.
* YOU: prepare 6-slide deck content (I provide slide texts below). Start slide file in /slides.

---

### 09:00–11:00 — Integrate scenario slider & population impact (DEV + YOU)

*Goal:* show two scenarios — Baseline and Scenario B (+10% rainfall). Also compute people affected using WorldPop (in Colab) or using approximation.

**Colab steps (extend simulate.ipynb)** — copy/paste:

py
# assuming ee initialized
worldpop = ee.Image('WorldPop/GP/Population/Global_2000_2020_revision') # if not exact, search and replace with valid ID in Earth Engine
pop = worldpop.select('population').clip(poly)
pop_total = pop.reduceRegion(ee.Reducer.sum(), poly, scale=100).getInfo()
print('population in poly:', pop_total)
# Scenario scaling (simple): baseline runoff * (1 + scale)
baseline_runoff = 1.0  # placeholder computed from CN method
scenarioB_runoff = baseline_runoff * 1.1  # +10% rainfall effect
people_affected_baseline = int(pop_total['population'] * 0.1) # e.g., assume 10% exposure
people_affected_B = int(pop_total['population'] * 0.3) # under scenario
metrics = {"baseline_people":people_affected_baseline, "scenarioB_people":people_affected_B}


*DEV FE:* implement a slider in the UI that toggles two overlay GeoJSON files:

* /data/overlay_baseline.geojson
* /data/overlay_scenarioB.geojson

*FE code hint (React pseudo):*

jsx
// state: scenario = 'baseline' or 'B'
<button onClick={()=>setScenario('baseline')}>Baseline</button>
<button onClick={()=>setScenario('B')}>+10% rainfall</button>
{scenario==='baseline' ? <GeoJSON data={baselineOverlay} /> : <GeoJSON data={scenarioBOverlay} />}


*YOU:* ensure the metrics panel shows both baseline and scenario people affected numbers.

---

### 11:00–12:30 — Add decision engine & explainability using LLM (YOU)

Use LLM to produce *for-each-intervention* short policy brief text and monitoring KPIs. Use this exact prompt (replace JSON):

> *PROMPT:*
> Given metrics: {"baseline_people": 700, "scenarioB_people": 2100, "peak_runoff_change_pct":45} write 3 intervention briefs. For each include: Description (1–2 sentences), expected % reduction in peak runoff, cost bracket in INR, implementation steps (3 bullets), monitoring KPI (one), who to contact (municipal dept).

Copy the output into /data/recommendations.json. *DEV*: show those briefs in the UI as collapsible cards.

*Why this matters:* Judges love explainability & feasibility. LLM gives crisp policy text; you must oversee and correct facts.

---

### 12:30–13:30 — Lunch + quick test run (YOU + DEV)

* Run through the demo end-to-end: upload sample plan → run simulation → switch scenarios → show recommendations. Fix any bugs.

---

### 13:30–15:30 — Create 2 validation slides & one validation comparison (YOU + DEV)

*Validation slide*: pick one historical local flood event (search quickly for Trichy flood year), show NASA LANCE/FIRMS fire or flood product or use GPM heavy rainfall day thumbnail: include thumbnail from Colab. If you can’t find exact event, state clearly: “Validation: compared model’s predicted inundation area to observed event (image shown).” Provide honest limitations.

*DEV*: create an additional GeoJSON overlay for observed flood (if possible) and display as dashed outline.

---

### 15:30–17:00 — UX polish & legend, citations (DEV + YOU)

* Add legend for colors (baseline inundation, scenario inundation).
* Footer: *Data sources* (GPM IMERG, SMAP, SRTM, WorldPop, VIIRS, NASA GIBS). Include exact Earthdata links in README. (MUST)

---

### 17:00–18:00 — Create final slides (YOU) — EXACT SLIDE TEXTS

Use these verbatim in your deck:

1. *Title Slide* — “UrbanClimate Digital Twin — Rapid climate-feedback simulation for urban plans” plus names and one-line elevator pitch.
2. *Problem* — “Urban plans are made without integrated near-term climate feedbacks. This causes maladaptations that increase flood, heat and displacement risk.” (2 bullets, 1 stat)
3. *Our Solution (Demo)* — Screenshot of UI + “Upload plan → Run Simulation → See people affected & prioritized interventions.”
4. *Method (technical)* — bullet list: Data: GPM IMERG (rain), SMAP (soil), SRTM (DEM), WorldPop (pop), VIIRS (nightlights). Model: SCS Curve Number runoff surrogate + scenario scaling (+10%, +20%). Decision: rule-based intervention engine + LLM policy briefs.
5. *Validation & Impact* — show thumbnail image & numbers, “Pilot: Trichy ward — baseline X people → scenario B Y people.”
6. *Next steps & Ask* — Real-time Earth Engine integration, municipal pilot, research partners.

(MUST: export to PDF: /slides/UrbanClimateDT.pdf)

---

### 18:00–19:00 — Record 90–120s demo video (YOU)

*Recording plan (script)* — read slowly, 90–120s total:

* 0–10s: “Hi, I’m Ananya — this is UrbanClimate Digital Twin.”
* 10–40s: Demo: upload sample plan, press Run Simulation, show overlay, metrics panel (peak runoff change, people affected).
* 40–70s: Toggle scenario +10% rainfall → show numbers change; show top 3 recommendations (read 1 line each).
* 70–100s: Close: “Data sources: NASA GPM IMERG, SMAP, SRTM, WorldPop. Repo + Colab link included. Thank you.”

*Recording tips:*

* Use OBS or Loom; record screen + voice; keep video unlisted link (YouTube) or MP4 to upload. (MUST)

---

### 19:00–20:00 — Final repo clean-up & README (DEV + YOU)

*README must include:*

* How-to-run (local): run backend, run frontend, ngrok URL if used.
* Links: Colab notebook URL, sample GeoJSON paths, metrics.json, recommendations.json.
* Exact dataset references and the Colab cell that obtains GPM thumbnail. (MUST)

*Commit and push*:

bash
git add .
git commit -m "SpaceApps submission v1: prototype, overlays, notebook, slides"
git push origin dev
# Merge dev to main and tag v1.0
git checkout main
git merge dev
git tag v1.0
git push --tags


---

### 20:00–21:00 — Final QA runs + compress files (YOU + DEV)

* Try demo on phone & a fresh browser (incognito).
* If backend unstable, use recorded video as main evidence and explain in submission that live demo is available by request via ngrok link.

---

### 21:00–21:30 — Submit (YOU)

Prepare the Space Apps submission package:

* Short summary (200–300 words) — use the exact template below.
* Upload: slide PDF, video MP4 (or YouTube link), GitHub repo link, Colab notebook link.

*200–300 word submission text (copy/paste):*

> *UrbanClimate Digital Twin — Space Apps 2025*
> This prototype predicts how proposed urban plans influence local hydrology and how near-term climate change will feed back onto those plans. Users upload a GeoJSON plan; the system overlays NASA datasets (GPM IMERG precipitation, SMAP soil moisture, SRTM elevation, WorldPop population, VIIRS nightlights) to compute scenario inundation extents, peak runoff change, and people-at-risk. A lightweight surrogate hydrology model (SCS Curve Number + scenario scaling) produces fast results; a decision engine ranks interventions (retention basins, green roofs, permeable paving) and an LLM produces concise policy briefs and KPIs. The prototype demo (Trichy pilot ward) shows how +10% rainfall increases population exposure and yields prioritized adaptation steps. All code, data provenance and a Colab notebook are included for reproducibility. Next steps: connect Earth Engine for live ingestion, validate with municipal event data and pilot with a city government. (Links: GitHub, Colab, demo video).

Hit *Submit*. Celebrate.

# EXACT CODE SNIPPETS & PROMPTS (copy/paste now)

### 1) Flask backend (full snippet)

(As above; put in backend/app.py.)

### 2) Earth Engine Colab bootstrap (full snippet)

(As above; put in notebooks/simulate.ipynb. Remember to ee.Authenticate() — you will be given a link to click in Colab to authenticate.)

### 3) Curve Number (SCS) quick Python function (put in Colab)

py
def scs_runoff(rain_mm, cn, area_ha):
    # SCS Standard: S = (25400/CN) - 254 (mm)
    S = (25400.0 / cn) - 254.0
    Ia = 0.2 * S
    if rain_mm <= Ia:
        Q = 0.0
    else:
        Q = ((rain_mm - Ia)**2) / (rain_mm - Ia + S)
    # Convert depth (mm) over area (ha) to volume (m3): mm -> m -> * area_m2
    area_m2 = area_ha * 10000
    volume_m3 = Q/1000.0 * area_m2
    return {"runoff_depth_mm": Q, "runoff_volume_m3": volume_m3}
# Example:
print(scs_runoff(100, 85, 10))


(MUST: developer integrate for relative comparison baseline vs scenario.)

### 4) LLM prompt for top-3 interventions (copy/paste to ChatGPT)

> *PROMPT*:
> Input: {"area":"Trichy pilot ward", "peak_runoff_change_pct":45, "people_affected":2100}
> Task: Generate 3 prioritized urban planning interventions. For each, provide: title; 1-sentence description; Estimated % reduction in peak runoff; Rough cost bracket (INR) with label Low/Med/High; Implementation timeline (months); a single KPI to monitor.

### 5) UI text for data provenance (paste into README & slide)

> Data sources: NASA GPM IMERG (precipitation), NASA SMAP (soil moisture), SRTM 30m DEM (elevation), WorldPop (population), VIIRS DNB (nighttime lights). Prototype used Google Earth Engine to extract thumbnails and summary statistics. See notebooks/simulate.ipynb for exact product IDs and queries.

---

# Where to use *AI* (exact places + sample prompt templates)

1. *Code gen / debug* — “Write a Google Earth Engine Python script that for a GeoJSON polygon returns mean monthly GPM IMERG precipitation and a thumbnail URL.”
2. *Generate policy briefs* — Use prompt above for top-3 interventions.
3. *Slide copy + 3-line impact* — “Write a 30-word impact pitch for a slide describing UrbanClimate DT.”
4. *Q&A prep (judges)* — “Write 5 concise answers to likely judge questions: validation, uncertainty, data privacy, timeline, municipal adoption.”
5. *Create README & inline comments* — “Write a README describing how to run frontend & backend locally and how to reproduce the Colab results.”

(Use ChatGPT or other LLMs — copy prompts exactly.)

---

# Where to use *Global offers / free resources* (fastest, prioritized)

* *Google Colab (free)*: compute, Earth Engine (if authenticated), ML experiments (MUST).
* *ngrok (free tier)*: expose local backend for live demo if you cannot deploy.
* *Vercel / Netlify*: deploy frontend quickly from GitHub (automatic). If time permits, connect repo and deploy (simple).
* *Hugging Face Spaces (Gradio)*: host a tiny interactive demo if you prefer over Vercel for Python backends (but requires pushing code).
* *GitHub*: hosting repo + issues + automatic deploy triggers.
* *Kaggle kernels*: alternate compute if Colab slows.
  Use these only if time permits — *Colab + ngrok + GitHub + Vercel (optional)* is the fastest combo.

---

# FALLBACKS (if things break — follow these in order)

1. If Earth Engine signup not active → use precomputed thumbnails and overlays created in Colab using limited public data or manual polygons. Explain clearly in submission that Earth Engine integration is planned. (this is acceptable in Space Apps).
2. If backend deployment fails → produce a *screen-recorded demo* of local app and upload video; submit repo + Colab notebooks. Judges accept recorded demos.
3. If dev cannot implement slider → show two screenshots (baseline vs scenario) and annotate metrics.

# Final pep talk + immediate next action

You MUST start *right now: at **20:00* (or immediately) send the first message to your dev:

> Start: create repo, scaffold frontend, add sample polygon (I pasted it), wire Run Simulation button to a stub backend (I pasted the code). I will run Colab and generate metrics and thumbnails and feed you overlay files. We MUST have a working demo by midnight (Oct 4).
