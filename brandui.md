NASA Space Apps Brand Guidelines
NASA Space Apps Brand Guidelines
With tens-of-thousands of participants in locations around the world, it's important to present a consistent and trustworthy image across all NASA Space Apps related media and communications, and to make use of brand elements in a predictable way. This NASA Space Apps Brand Guidelines has been designed to help you understand the rules for correct application of NASA Space Apps' visual brand across print and digital media. This includes logo usage, colors, photography, fonts, patterns, and icons.

Logos
The NASA Space Apps Logo can be considered a “responsive” logo. This means that it takes one of several forms depending on the space and resolution constraints.

The Default Logo should be considered the preferred option, as it is designed to look best in the widest range of applications.

Space Apps Logo
The Motif and Small versions of the logo should be used in more space limited applications. More details for their uses are in the brand guidelines.

Colors
The color palette strongly favors blue, with multiple vibrant shades meant to evoke the depths of space, the energy of discovery, or the purity of a flame. NASA Space Apps also makes its own mark through the addition of Neon Yellow, a bright and exuberant fluorescent hue that symbolizes the brilliance of fresh ideas and the clarity of sunlight. It should not be used as a background color, but as an accent color for text, buttons, and symbols.

When using color combinations, ensure that contrast ratios meet or exceed 4.5:1. Easily check the color contrast scores of color combinations by using the online WebAIM Contrast Checker tool.

When desired, a gradient effect can be used in the background of designs. The gradient should be linear and should extend from the top-left Electric Blue toward the bottom-right Deep Blue, ideally at a 45° angle as it descends. The gradient transition should take place across the entirety of the field, and not abruptly. If necessary, manually ease the gradient such that the transition between colors does not appear sudden or otherwise stand out in any way — it should be a gentle fade.

Typography color: Bodies of text should only be placed against deep blue, electric blue, or white. Avoid using Rocket Red as a background color. Special combinations of text colors are available to use to differentiate between content sections. Use Neon Yellow sparingly, ideally to make text stand out from other text. More details for their uses are in the brand guidelines.

Shapes, Symbols, Awards
Shapes and Symbols should be used only when their meaning is reasonably unambiguous. Otherwise, prefer text labels over symbols. Suitable icon libraries include Phosphor or Feather styles.

Awards are depicted as illustrated 3D icons representing the award categories. Awards can be placed into circular holding shape to create a “badge,” if desired.

Patterns
A number of patterns have been created to use in NASA Space Apps materials to add visual interest to a composition. They represent abstractions of things such as orbits, coordinates, waves, cells, code, and geometry, and help lend a scientific or technological look and feel wherever they are used.

These patterns should be screened back to roughly 25% opacity over a brand color, preferably one in the blue range.
